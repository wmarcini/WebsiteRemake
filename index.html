        <p>Chicago Pet Rescue is a non-profit orginization that is foster home and volunteer-based rescue. Dedicated to rescuing stray and abandoned animals. We do not have a central "shelter" as most of our animals are placed in foster homes until forever homes can be found.<br><br>Our goal is to rescue as many animals as we can safely manage through foster homes. We rescue dogs, puppies, cats, kittens, birds and other small animals.</p>
